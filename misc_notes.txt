they have Scenarios
scenarios are laid out "Given" (setup) "When" (I do X) "Then" (a result)


Seem slow? Of course.
Try gem 'spork' - which loads an instance of rails that stays booted, instead of booting over and over
but what if you change config?
try gem 'guard' -- it watches files that change (in say, /config) and take action (like reboot spork)
